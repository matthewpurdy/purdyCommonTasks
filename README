purdyCommonTask is an ant macro file use to help create a quick build system using:
1) java
2) groovy
3) javadocs
4) groovydocs
5) emma
6) cobertura


the source code and test code is here just to demonstrate it.  the three files you need to put in your project are:
1) build.properties
2) build.xml
3) purdyCommonTasks.xml

modify build.properties for your system settings

run ant

you can also added the build.gradle to your project, which is used to download from maven the dependencies and put in the 
lib directory.  this way there is no need to store jar file in git (note: jar files are in this git repo for demo purposes only)

run gradle updateLibs


to run all of this you need the following software:
1) Java 6 or greater
2) Gradle 1.x or greater
3) Ant 1.7.x or greater
4) Emma 2.0.5312 or greater
6) Cobertura 1.9.4.1 or greater


once you build a project
1) copy all 4 files above in the root of the project (assumes a non-maven style project)
2) run gradle updateLibs
3) run ant
